# MemeMe2
In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

## You will learn how to:
* Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app.
* Build tables with datasources and delegates.
* Create custom table view cells.
* Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views.
